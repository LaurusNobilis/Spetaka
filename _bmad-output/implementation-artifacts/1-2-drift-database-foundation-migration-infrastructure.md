# Story 1.2: Drift Database Foundation & Migration Infrastructure

Status: done

## Story

As a developer,
I want an AppDatabase class with migration strategy and a clean DAO infrastructure in place,
so that all feature stories can add their entities and queries to a stable, well-structured database layer without conflicts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the Flutter project scaffold from Story 1.1 exists, when the Drift database foundation is set up, then `lib/core/database/app_database.dart` exists with `AppDatabase extends _$AppDatabase`, `schemaVersion = 1`, and `MigrationStrategy` with `onUpgrade` and `beforeOpen` hooks.
2. `lib/core/database/daos/` contains empty DAO stub files: `friend_dao.dart`, `event_dao.dart`, `acquittement_dao.dart`, `settings_dao.dart` — each with a class declaration and a placeholder for future queries.
3. `AppDatabase` is exposed as a Riverpod provider via `@riverpod` code generation, accessible from any feature.
4. `NativeDatabase.memory()` is confirmed working in tests for an in-memory database fixture.
5. `flutter test test/unit/database_foundation_test.dart` passes and verifies DB open, `schemaVersion = 1`, and migration hooks callable without error.

  - [x] Validate database open, schema version, and migration strategy callbacks

## Dev Notes

- This story establishes the persistence backbone for all friend, event, acquittement, and settings features.
- Keep DAOs intentionally minimal at this stage: SQL queries are introduced in later stories.
- Follow repository layering constraints defined in architecture:
  - DAOs hold SQL concerns only.
  - Business logic remains outside DAOs.
  - Riverpod providers expose reactive access patterns.
- Preserve compatibility with planned timestamp storage strategy (Unix epoch milliseconds) and future migrations.

### Project Structure Notes

- Database concerns should stay under `lib/core/database/`.
- DAO stubs must be isolated in `lib/core/database/daos/` to prevent feature leakage and maintain clean architecture boundaries.
- Naming should match domain vocabulary from planning artifacts to reduce future refactor risk.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.6

### Debug Log References

- Riverpod v3 (riverpod_generator v4) generates `Ref` as the provider function parameter type instead of the legacy `XxxRef` pattern. Updated function signature to `AppDatabase appDatabase(Ref ref)` accordingly.
- All 5 story tests pass; full suite 33/33 green with no regressions.

### Completion Notes List

- ✅ AC1: `lib/core/database/app_database.dart` created — `AppDatabase extends _$AppDatabase`, `schemaVersion = 1`, `MigrationStrategy` with `onUpgrade` (no-op, ready for future migrations) and `beforeOpen` (enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`).
- ✅ AC2: Four DAO stubs created under `lib/core/database/daos/`: `friend_dao.dart`, `event_dao.dart`, `acquittement_dao.dart`, `settings_dao.dart` — each a `DatabaseAccessor<AppDatabase>` with `@DriftAccessor(tables: [])` + placeholder comment for the host epic.
- ✅ AC3: `@riverpod AppDatabase appDatabase(Ref ref)` annotation generates `appDatabaseProvider` via `build_runner`.  Provider calls `ref.onDispose(db.close)` for safe resource management.
- ✅ AC4: `AppDatabase([QueryExecutor? executor])` accepts `NativeDatabase.memory()` in tests; confirmed working in all 5 unit tests.
- ✅ AC5: `flutter test test/unit/database_foundation_test.dart` — 5/5 pass (DB open, `schemaVersion == 1`, `onUpgrade` hook non-null, `beforeOpen` hook non-null, `PRAGMA foreign_keys = 1`).
- `lib/core/core.dart` updated to barrel-export the new database layer.

### Change Log

- 2026-02-27: Implemented Story 1.2 — Drift database foundation. Created AppDatabase with schemaVersion=1 and MigrationStrategy, four DAO stubs, Riverpod @riverpod provider, barrel exports, and 5 passing unit tests. Status: ready-for-dev → review.
- 2026-02-27: Code review by AI (Amelia). 1 HIGH + 2 MEDIUM + 4 LOW issues found. HIGH + MEDIUM auto-fixed. Status: review → done.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

_Reviewer: Laurus — 2026-02-27_

**Outcome: ✅ APPROVED** (after auto-fixes applied)

### Issues Found & Fixed

| # | Severity | Issue | Resolution |
|---|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | 🔴 HIGH | `@riverpod` defaulted to `autoDispose=true` — database closed on every navigation transition, silent data-loss/latency risk | Changed to `@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)`; regenerated `.g.dart` |
| 2 | 🟡 MEDIUM | DAOs exported from `core.dart` barrel — any feature could bypass repository layer and import DAOs directly | Removed DAO exports; only `AppDatabase` stays in barrel; comment added explaining intent |
| 3 | 🟡 MEDIUM | `_openConnection()` had no error handling — raw `MissingPluginException`/`StateError` would surface with no context | Added `try/catch` wrapping `FlutterError.reportError` before rethrow |
| 4 | 🟢 LOW | Redundant `import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart'` dragged Flutter widget layer into persistence file | Removed; `Ref` comes from `riverpod_annotation` |
| 5 | 🟢 LOW | `migration` getter had no `///` doc-comment (inconsistent with rest of class) | Added doc-comment |

### Deferred Action Items

- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Test `PRAGMA foreign_keys` — remove redundant pre-query `SELECT 1` to simplify intent [`test/unit/database_foundation_test.dart`]
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Generate Drift schema snapshot (`drift_schemas/`) before first `schemaVersion` bump — add as DoD task to Story 1.3 or first story that introduces a real table
