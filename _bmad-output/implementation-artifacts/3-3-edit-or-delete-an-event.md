As Laurus, I want to edit or delete events so event data stays accurate over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Event edit form opens prefilled with current values.
2. Save updates event record and timestamps where applicable.
3. Delete action requires confirmation dialog.

- [ ] Add tests for update/delete scenarios.
