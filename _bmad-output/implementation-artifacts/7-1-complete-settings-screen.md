Status: ready-for-dev

## Story
As Laurus, I want one complete settings screen so all app configuration is centralized and easy to manage.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Settings sections cover Sync/Backup, Data, Display, Event Types.
2. Toggle-type settings apply immediately (no Save button).
3. WebDAV setup/update/reset links and actions are available.
