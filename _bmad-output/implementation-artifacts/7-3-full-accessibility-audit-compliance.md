Status: ready-for-dev

## Story
As Laurus (and all users), I want fully accessible core flows so Spetaka is usable and compliant.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Core interactive elements expose meaningful TalkBack descriptions.
2. All touch targets satisfy 48x48dp minimum.
3. Text contrast satisfies WCAG AA.
4. No long-press-only interactions without accessible alternative.
5. Widget tests include semantics assertions for key controls.
6. Manual TalkBack walkthrough validates daily ritual completion.

## Tasks
- [ ] Perform and fix semantics audit across core screens.
- [ ] Validate touch targets and contrast token usage.
- [ ] Add accessibility-focused widget tests.
- [ ] Document manual TalkBack verification run.
